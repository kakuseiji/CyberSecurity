If a vulnerability is found in the operational version of a web server and there is no immediate fix available from the vendor, a security officer can consider the following measures:

Apply Emergency Patches: If the vendor provides a patch, apply it promptly.
Enhanced Log Monitoring: Strengthen log monitoring to detect suspicious access or unusual activities.
Update Security Products: Check for the latest security updates for security products and VPN devices, and apply them.
Network Segmentation: Isolate the vulnerable web server from the network to prevent exploitation by attackers.
Implement a WAF: Introduce a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter out malicious traffic.
Strengthen Access Control: Limit communications to only what is necessary to reduce the attack surface.
Develop an Incident Response Plan: Prepare for potential incidents by developing and training an incident response plan.
External Security Audits: Regularly undergo security audits by external experts to identify vulnerabilities.
These measures are interim solutions until the vulnerability is resolved but are effective in mitigating security risks. Even after the vulnerability is addressed, these measures contribute to ongoing security enhancement. For more detailed information, please refer to official websites like the Information-technology Promotion Agency (IPA) or specialized security websites.
